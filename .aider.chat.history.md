Based on your requests, the files most likely needing changes are:

- **components/TableOfContents.tsx** – to fix the text color in dark mode and correct the mixed-up texts.
- **components/Layout.tsx** – to adjust the overall layout and add a gap between the footer and the TOC component.
- **components/DocsHelp.tsx** – to repair the "Edit this page on GitHub" link appearance.
- **pages/overview/pro-help/index.page.tsx** – to adjust the layout for the /pro-help page and any related pages.

Please add these files to the chat if you'd like me to propose the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the necessary changes.

#### It requires more gap between footer and TOC component  
#### Edit this page on GitHub looks broken it needs to be fixed.  
#### /pro-help and other pages looks odd after adding this feature, so you need to adjust the overall layout of the pages  

Below are the proposed changes. I've identified four modifications:

1. In **components/TableOfContents.tsx**, add extra bottom spacing (mb-8) to separate the TOC from the footer and update the list-item classes so that the text color is improved for dark mode and the spacing between items is increased.
2. In **components/DocsHelp.tsx**, update the "Edit this page on GitHub" link to use inline-flex and center items.
3. In **components/Layout.tsx**, increase the top padding (pt-4 → pt-12) on the main element to improve the overall layout seen on pro-help and other pages.

Below are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for these changes:
