  <h1 id="rfc.abstract"><a href="#rfc.abstract">Abstract</a></h1>
<p>JSON Schema defines the media type "application/schema+json", a JSON-based format for describing the structure of JSON data.  JSON Schema asserts what a JSON document must look like, ways to extract information from it, and how to interact with it.  The "application/schema-instance+json" media type provides additional feature-rich integration with "application/schema+json" beyond what can be offered for "application/json" documents.  </p>

  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">JSON Schema is a JSON media type for defining the structure of JSON data. JSON Schema is intended to define validation, documentation, hyperlink navigation, and interaction control of JSON data.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">This specification defines JSON Schema core terminology and mechanisms, including pointing to another JSON Schema by reference, dereferencing a JSON Schema reference, specifying the vocabulary being used, and defining the expected output.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">Other specifications define the vocabularies that perform assertions about validation, linking, annotation, navigation, and interaction.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.2">2.</a> Conventions and Terminology</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="#RFC2119" class="xref">RFC 2119</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.p.2">The terms "JSON", "JSON text", "JSON value", "member", "element", "object", "array", "number", "string", "boolean", "true", "false", and "null" in this document are to be interpreted as defined in <a href="#RFC8259" class="xref">RFC 8259</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.3">3.</a> Overview</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.1">This document proposes a new media type "application/schema+json" to identify a JSON Schema for describing JSON data.  It also proposes a further optional media type, "application/schema-instance+json", to provide additional integration features.  JSON Schemas are themselves JSON documents.  This, and related specifications, define keywords allowing authors to describe JSON data in several ways.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.2">JSON Schema uses keywords to assert constraints on JSON instances or annotate those instances with additional information.  Additional keywords are used to apply assertions and annotations to more complex JSON data structures, or based on some sort of condition.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.3">To facilitate re-use, keywords can be organized into vocabularies.  A vocabulary consists of a list of keywords, together with their syntax and semantics.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.4">JSON Schema can be extended either by defining additional vocabularies, or less formally by defining additional keywords outside of any vocabulary.  Unrecognized individual keywords are ignored, while the behavior with respect to an unrecognized vocabulary can be controlled when declaring which vocabularies are in use.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.5">This document defines a core vocabulary that MUST be supported by any implementation, and cannot be disabled.  Its keywords are each prefixed with a "$" character to emphasize their required nature.  This vocabulary is essential to the functioning of the "application/schema+json" media type, and is used to bootstrap the loading of other vocabularies.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.6">Additionally, this document defines a RECOMMENDED vocabulary of keywords for applying subschemas conditionally, and for applying subschemas to the contents of objects and arrays.  Either this vocabulary or one very much like it is required to write schemas for non-trivial JSON instances, whether those schemas are intended for assertion validation, annotation, or both.  While not part of the required core vocabulary, for maximum interoperability this additional vocabulary is included in this document and its use is strongly encouraged.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.p.7">Further vocabularies for purposes such as structural validation or hypermedia annotation are defined in other documents.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4">4.</a> Definitions</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.1">4.1.</a> JSON Document</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.1">A JSON document is an information resource (series of octets) described by the application/json media type.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.2">In JSON Schema, the terms "JSON document", "JSON text", and "JSON value" are interchangeable because of the data model it defines.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.1.p.3">JSON Schema is only defined over JSON documents. However, any document or memory structure that can be parsed into or processed according to the JSON Schema data model can be interpreted against a JSON Schema, including media types like <a href="#RFC7049" class="xref">CBOR</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2">4.2.</a> Instance</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.p.1">A JSON document to which a schema is applied is known as an "instance".  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2.1">4.2.1.</a> Instance Data Model</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.1">JSON Schema interprets documents according to a data model. A JSON value interpreted according to this data model is called an "instance".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.2">An instance has one of six primitive types, and a range of possible values depending on the type: </p>

<dl>
<dt>null:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A JSON "null" production</dd>
<dt>boolean:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A "true" or "false" value, from the JSON "true" or "false" productions</dd>
<dt>object:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">An unordered set of properties mapping a string to an instance, from the JSON "object" production</dd>
<dt>array:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">An ordered list of instances, from the JSON "array" production</dd>
<dt>number:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">An arbitrary-precision, base-10 decimal number value, from the JSON "number" production</dd>
<dt>string:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A string of Unicode code points, from the JSON "string" production</dd>
</dl>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.3">Whitespace and formatting concerns, including different lexical representations of numbers that are equal within the data model, are thus outside the scope of JSON Schema.  JSON Schema <a href="#vocabulary" class="xref">vocabularies</a> that wish to work with such differences in lexical representations SHOULD define keywords to precisely interpret formatted strings within the data model rather than relying on having the original JSON representation Unicode characters available.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.4">Since an object cannot have two properties with the same key, behavior for a JSON document that tries to define two properties (the "member" production) with the same key (the "string" production) in a single object is undefined.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.1.p.5">Note that JSON Schema vocabularies are free to define their own extended type system.  This should not be confused with the core data model types defined here.  As an example, "integer" is a reasonable type for a vocabulary to define as a value for a keyword, but the data model makes no distinction between integers and other numbers.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2.2">4.2.2.</a> Instance Media Types</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.1">JSON Schema is designed to fully work with "application/json" documents, as well as media types using the "+json" structured syntax suffix.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.2">Some functionality that is useful for working with schemas is defined by each media type, namely media type parameters and URI fragment identifier syntax and semantics.  These features are useful in content negotiation and in calculating URIs for specific locations within an instance, respectively.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.2.p.3">This specification defines the "application/schema-instance+json" media type in order to allow instance authors to take full advantage of parameters and fragment identifiers for these purposes.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.2.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.2.3">4.2.3.</a> Instance Equality</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.1">Two JSON instances are said to be equal if and only if they are of the same type and have the same value according to the data model. Specifically, this means: </p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>both are null; or</li>
<li>both are true; or</li>
<li>both are false; or</li>
<li>both are strings, and are the same codepoint-for-codepoint; or</li>
<li>both are numbers, and have the same mathematical value; or</li>
<li>both are arrays, and have an equal value item-for-item; or</li>
<li>both are objects, and each property in one has exactly one property with a key equal to the other's, and that other property has an equal value.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.2.3.p.2">Implied in this definition is that arrays must be the same length, objects must have the same number of members, properties in objects are unordered, there is no way to define multiple properties with the same key, and mere formatting differences (indentation, placement of commas, trailing zeros) are insignificant.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3">4.3.</a> <a href="#schema-document" id="schema-document">JSON Schema Documents</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.1">A JSON Schema document, or simply a schema, is a JSON document used to describe an instance.  A schema can itself be interpreted as an instance, but SHOULD always be given the media type "application/schema+json" rather than "application/schema-instance+json".  The "application/schema+json" media type is defined to offer a superset of the media type parameter and fragment identifier syntax and semantics provided by "application/schema-instance+json".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.p.2">A JSON Schema MUST be an object or a boolean.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3.1">4.3.1.</a> JSON Schema Objects and Keywords</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.1">Object properties that are applied to the instance are called keywords, or schema keywords.  Broadly speaking, keywords fall into one of four categories: </p>

<dl>
<dt>identifiers:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">control schema identification through setting the schema's canonical URI and/or changing how the base URI is determined </dd>
<dt>assertions:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">produce a boolean result when applied to an instance </dd>
<dt>annotations:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">attach information to an instance for application use </dd>
<dt>applicators:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">apply one or more subschemas to a particular location in the instance, and combine or modify their results </dd>
<dt>reserved locations:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">do not directly affect results, but reserve a place for a specific purpose to ensure interoperability </dd>
</dl>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.2">Keywords may fall into multiple categories, although applicators SHOULD only produce assertion results based on their subschemas' results.  They should not define additional constraints independent of their subschemas.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.3">Extension keywords, meaning those defined outside of this document and its companions, are free to define other behaviors as well.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.4">A JSON Schema MAY contain properties which are not schema keywords.  Unknown keywords SHOULD be ignored.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.1.p.5">An empty schema is a JSON Schema with no properties, or only unknown properties.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3.2">4.3.2.</a> Boolean JSON Schemas</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.2.p.1">The boolean schema values "true" and "false" are trivial schemas that always produce themselves as assertions results, regardless of the instance value.  They never produce annotation results.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.2.p.2">These boolean schemas exist to clarify schema author intent and facilitate schema processing optimizations.  They behave identically to the following schema objects (where "not" is part of the subschema application vocabulary defined in this document).  </p>

<dl>
<dt>true:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Always passes validation, as if the empty schema {} </dd>
<dt>false:</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">Always fails validation, as if the schema { "not": {} } </dd>
</dl>

<p> While the empty schema object is unambiguous, there are many possible equivalents to the "false" schema.  Using the boolean values ensures that the intent is clear to both human readers and implementations.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3.3">4.3.3.</a> Schema Vocabularies</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.3.p.1">A schema vocabulary, or simply a vocabulary, is a set of keywords, their syntax, and their semantics.  A vocabulary is generally organized around a particular purpose.  Different uses of JSON Schema, such as validation, hypermedia, or user interface generation, will involve different sets of vocabularies.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.3.p.2">Vocabularies are the primary unit of re-use in JSON Schema, as schema authors can indicate what vocabularies are required or optional in order to process the schema.  Since vocabularies are identified by URIs in the meta-schema, generic implementations can load extensions to support previously unknown vocabularies.  While keywords can be supported outside of any vocabulary, there is no analogous mechanism to indicate individual keyword usage.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3.4">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3.4">4.3.4.</a> Meta-Schemas</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.4.p.1">A schema that itself describes a schema is called a meta-schema.  Meta-schemas are used to validate JSON Schemas and specify which vocabularies they are using.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.4.p.2">Typically, a meta-schema will specify a set of vocabularies, and validate schemas that conform to the syntax of those vocabularies.  However, meta-schemas and vocabularies are separate in order to allow meta-schemas to validate schema conformance more strictly or more loosely than the vocabularies' specifications call for.  Meta-schemas may also describe and validate additional keywords that are not part of a formal vocabulary.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.4.3.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.4.3.5">4.3.5.</a> <a href="#root" id="root">Root Schema and Subschemas and Resources</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.5.p.1">A JSON Schema resource is a schema which is <a href="#RFC6596" class="xref">canonically</a> identified by an <a href="#RFC3986" class="xref">absolute URI</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.5.p.2">The root schema is the schema that comprises the entire JSON document in question.  The root schema is always a schema resource, where the URI is determined as described in section <a href="#initial-base" class="xref">8.2.1</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.5.p.3">Some keywords take schemas themselves, allowing JSON Schemas to be nested: </p>
<pre>

{
    "title": "root",
    "items": {
        "title": "array item"
    }
}

                        </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.5.p.4">In this example document, the schema titled "array item" is a subschema, and the schema titled "root" is the root schema.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.5.p.5">As with the root schema, a subschema is either an object or a boolean.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.3.5.p.6">As discussed in section <a href="#id-keyword" class="xref">8.2.2</a>, a JSON Schema document can contain multiple JSON Schema resources.  When used without qualification, the term "root schema" refers to the document's root schema.  In some cases, resource root schemas are discussed.  A resource's root schema is its top-level schema object, which would also be a document root schema if the resource were to be extracted to a standalone JSON Schema document.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.5">
<a href="#rfc.section.5">5.</a> <a href="#fragments" id="fragments">Fragment Identifiers</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">In accordance with section 3.1 of <a href="#RFC6839" class="xref">[RFC6839]</a>, the syntax and semantics of fragment identifiers specified for any +json media type SHOULD be as specified for "application/json".

<a href="#rfc.section.7">7.</a> Keyword Behaviors</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.1">JSON Schema keywords fall into several general behavior categories.  Assertions validate that an instance satisfies constraints, producing a boolean result.  Annotations attach information that applications may use in any way they see fit.  Applicators apply subschemas to parts of the instance and combine their results.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.2">Extension keywords SHOULD stay within these categories, keeping in mind that annotations in particular are extremely flexible.  Complex behavior is usually better delegated to applications on the basis of annotation data than implemented directly as schema keywords.  However, extension keywords MAY define other behaviors for specialized purposes.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.3">Evaluating an instance against a schema involves processing all of the keywords in the schema against the appropriate locations within the instance.  Typically, applicator keywords are processed until a schema object with no applicators (and therefore no subschemas) is reached.  The appropriate location in the instance is evaluated against the assertion and annotation keywords in the schema object, and their results are gathered into the parent schema according to the rules of the applicator.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.p.4">Evaluation of a parent schema object can complete once all of its subschemas have been evaluated, although in some circumstances evaluation may be short-circuited due to assertion results.  When annotations are being collected, some assertion result short-circuiting is not possible due to the need to examine all subschemas for annotation collection, including those that cannot further change the assertion result.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.1">7.1.</a> <a href="#scopes" id="scopes">Lexical Scope and Dynamic Scope</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.1">While most JSON Schema keywords can be evaluated on their own, or at most need to take into account the values or results of adjacent keywords in the same schema object, a few have more complex behavior.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.2">The lexical scope of a keyword is determined by the nested JSON data structure of objects and arrays.  The largest such scope is an entire schema document.  The smallest scope is a single schema object with no subschemas.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.3">Keywords MAY be defined with a partial value, such as a URI-reference, which must be resolved against another value, such as another URI-reference or a full URI, which is found through the lexical structure of the JSON document.  The "$id" core keyword and the "base" JSON Hyper-Schema keyword are examples of this sort of behavior.  Additionally, "$ref" and "$recursiveRef" from this specification resolve their values in this way, although they do not change how further values are resolved.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.4">Note that some keywords, such as "$schema", apply to the lexical scope of the entire schema document, and therefore MUST only appear in a schema resource's root schema.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.5">Other keywords may take into account the dynamic scope that exists during the evaluation of a schema, typically together with an instance document.  The outermost dynamic scope is the root schema of the schema document in which processing begins.  The path from this root schema to any particular keyword (that includes any "$ref" and "$recursiveRef" keywords that may have been resolved) is considered the keyword's "validation path." <a id="CREF1" class="info">[CREF1]<span class="info">Or should this be the schema object at which processing begins, even if it is not a root?  This has some implications for the case where "$recursiveAnchor" is only allowed in the root schema but processing begins in a subschema.  </span></a> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.6">Lexical and dynamic scopes align until a reference keyword is encountered.  While following the reference keyword moves processing from one lexical scope into a different one, from the perspective of dynamic scope, following reference is no different from descending into a subschema present as a value.  A keyword on the far side of that reference that resolves information through the dynamic scope will consider the originating side of the reference to be their dynamic parent, rather than examining the local lexically enclosing parent.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.1.p.7">The concept of dynamic scope is primarily used with "$recursiveRef" and "$recursiveAnchor", and should be considered an advanced feature and used with caution when defining additional keywords.  It also appears when reporting errors and collected annotations, as it may be possible to revisit the same lexical scope repeatedly with different dynamic scopes.  In such cases, it is important to inform the user of the dynamic path that produced the error or annotation.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.2">7.2.</a> Keyword Interactions</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.2.p.1">Keyword behavior MAY be defined in terms of the annotation results of <a href="#root" class="xref">subschemas</a> and/or adjacent keywords.  Such keywords MUST NOT result in a circular dependency.  Keywords MAY modify their behavior based on the presence or absence of another keyword in the same <a href="#schema-document" class="xref">schema object</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.3">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.3">7.3.</a> Default Behaviors</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.1">A missing keyword MUST NOT produce a false assertion result, MUST NOT produce annotation results, and MUST NOT cause any other schema to be evaluated as part of its own behavioral definition.  However, given that missing keywords do not contribute annotations, the lack of annotation results may indirectly change the behavior of other keywords.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.2">In some cases, the missing keyword assertion behavior of a keyword is identical to that produced by a certain value, and keyword definitions SHOULD note such values where known.  However, even if the value which produces the default behavior would produce annotation results if present, the default behavior still MUST NOT result in annotations.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.3.p.3">Because annotation collection can add significant cost in terms of both computation and memory, implementations MAY opt out of this feature.  Keywords known to an implementation to have assertion or applicator behavior that depend on annotation results MUST then be treated as errors, unless an alternate implementation producing the same behavior is available.  Keywords of this sort SHOULD describe reasonable alternate approaches when appropriate.  This approach is demonstrated by the "<a href="#additionalItems" class="xref">additionalItems</a>" and "<a href="#additionalProperties" class="xref">additionalProperties</a>" keywords in this document.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.1">Identifiers set the canonical URI of a schema, or affect how such URIs are resolved in <a href="#references" class="xref">references</a>, or both.  The Core vocabulary defined in this document defines several identifying keywords, most notably "$id".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.2">Canonical schema URIs MUST NOT change while processing an instance, but keywords that affect URI-reference resolution MAY have behavior that is only fully determined at runtime.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.4.p.3">While custom identifier keywords are possible, vocabulary designers should take care not to disrupt the functioning of core keywords.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.1">Applicators allow for building more complex schemas than can be accomplished with a single schema object.  Evaluation of an instance against a <a href="#schema-document" class="xref">schema document</a> begins by applying the <a href="#root" class="xref">root schema</a> to the complete instance document.  From there, keywords known as applicators are used to determine which additional schemas are applied.  Such schemas may be applied in-place to the current location, or to a child location.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.2">The schemas to be applied may be present as subschemas comprising all or part of the keyword's value.  Alternatively, an applicator may refer to a schema elsewhere in the same schema document, or in a different one.  The mechanism for identifying such referenced schemas is defined by the keyword.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.p.3">Applicator keywords also define how subschema or referenced schema boolean <a href="#assertions" class="xref">assertion</a> results are modified and/or combined to produce the boolean result of the applicator.  Applicators may apply any boolean logic operation to the assertion results of subschemas, but MUST NOT introduce new assertion conditions of their own.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.1.p.1">As noted in <a href="#applicators" class="xref">Section 7.5</a>, an applicator keyword may refer to a schema to be applied, rather than including it as a subschema in the applicator's value.  In such situations, the schema being applied is known as the referenced schema, while the schema containing the applicator keyword is the referencing schema.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.1.p.2">While root schemas and subschemas are static concepts based on a schema's position within a schema document, referenced and referencing schemas are dynamic.  Different pairs of schemas may find themselves in various referenced and referencing arrangements during the evaluation of an instance against a schema.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.5.1.p.3">For some by-reference applicators, such as <a href="#ref" class="xref">"$ref"</a>, the referenced schema can be determined by static analysis of the schema document's lexical scope.  Others, such as "$recursiveRef" and "$recursiveAnchor",  may make use of dynamic scoping, and therefore only be resolvable in the process of evaluating the schema with an instance.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.6">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.6">7.6.</a> <a href="#assertions" id="assertions">Assertions</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.6.p.1">JSON Schema can be used to assert constraints on a JSON document, which either passes or fails the assertions.  This approach can be used to validate conformance with the constraints, or document what is needed to satisfy them.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.6.p.2">JSON Schema implementations produce a single boolean result when evaluating an instance against schema assertions.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.6.p.3">An instance can only fail an assertion that is present in the schema.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.6.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.6.1">7.6.1.</a> Assertions and Instance Primitive Types</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.6.1.p.1">Most assertions only constrain values within a certain primitive type.  When the type of the instance is not of the type targeted by the keyword, the instance is considered to conform to the assertion.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.6.1.p.2">For example, the "maxLength" keyword from the companion <a href="#json-schema-validation" class="xref">validation vocabulary</a>: will only restrict certain strings (that are too long) from being valid.  If the instance is a number, boolean, null, array, or object, then it is valid against this assertion.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.6.1.p.3">This behavior allows keywords to be used more easily with instances that can be of multiple primitive types.  The companion validation vocabulary also includes a "type" keyword which can independently restrict the instance to one or more primitive types.  This allows for a concise expression of use cases such as a function that might return either a string of a certain length or a null value: </p>
<pre>

{
    "type": ["string", "null"],
    "maxLength": 255
}

                        </pre>
<p>If "maxLength" also restricted the instance type to be a string, then this would be substantially more cumbersome to express because the example as written would not actually allow null values.  Each keyword is evaluated separately unless explicitly specified otherwise, so if "maxLength" restricted the instance to strings, then including "null" in "type" would not have any useful effect.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.7.7.p.1">JSON Schema can annotate an instance with information, whenever the instance validates against the schema object containing the annotation, and all of its parent schema objects.  The information can be a simple value, or can be calculated based on the instance contents.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.p.2">Annotations are attached to specific locations in an instance.  Since many subschemas can be applied to any single location, annotation keywords need to specify any unusual handling of multiple applicable occurrences of the keyword with different values.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.p.3">Unlike assertion results, annotation data can take a wide variety of forms, which are provided to applications to use as they see fit.  JSON Schema implementations are not expected to make use of the collected information on behalf of applications.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.p.4">Unless otherwise specified, the value of an annotation keyword's annotation is the keyword's value.  However, other behaviors are possible.  For example, <a href="#json-hyper-schema" class="xref">JSON Hyper-Schema's</a> "links" keyword is a complex annotation that produces a value based in part on the instance data.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.p.5">While "short-circuit" evaluation is possible for assertions, collecting annotations requires examining all schemas that apply to an instance location, even if they cannot change the overall assertion result.  The only exception is that subschemas of a schema object that has failed validation MAY be skipped, as annotations are not retained for failing schemas.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.7.7.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.7.7.1">7.7.1.</a> Collecting Annotations</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.1.p.1">Annotations are collected by keywords that explicitly define annotation-collecting behavior.  Note that boolean schemas cannot produce annotations as they do not make use of keywords.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.1.p.2">A collected annotation MUST include the following information: </p>

<ul class="empty">
<li>The name of the keyword that produces the annotation </li>
<li>The instance location to which it is attached, as a JSON Pointer </li>
<li>The schema location path, indicating how reference keywords such as "$ref" were followed to reach the absolute schema location.  </li>
<li>The absolute schema location of the attaching keyword, as a URI.  This MAY be omitted if it is the same as the schema location path from above.  </li>
<li>The attached value(s) </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.1.p.3">If the same keyword attaches values from multiple schema locations to the same instance location, and the annotation defines a process for combining such values, then the combined value MUST also be associated with the instance location.

Therefore the application has to decide how to handle the additional "default" value for Feature A, and the additional "description" value for Feature B.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.1.1.p.4">The application programmer and the schema author need to agree on the usage.  For this example, let's assume that they agree that the most specific "default" value will be used, and any additional, more generic "default" values will be silently ignored.  Let's also assume that they agree that all "description" text is to be used, starting with the most generic, and ending with the most specific.  This requires the schema author to write descriptions that work when combined in this way.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.1.1.p.5">The application can use the schema location path to determine which values are which.  The values in the feature's immediate "enabled" property schema are more specific, while the values under the re-usable schema that is referenced to with "$ref" are more generic.  The schema location path will show whether each value was found by crossing a "$ref" or not.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.7.7.1.1.p.6">Feature A will therefore use a default value of true, while Feature B will use the generic default value of null.

<p id="rfc.section.8.1.p.1">Two concepts, meta-schemas and vocabularies, are used to inform an implementation how to interpret a schema.  Every schema has a meta-schema, which can be declared using the "$schema" keyword.  </p>

<dt>Declaring the vocabularies in use</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">The "$vocabulary" keyword, when it appears in a meta-schema, declares which vocabularies are available to be used in schemas that refer to that meta-schema.  Vocabularies define keyword semantics, as well as their general syntax.  </dd>
<dt>Describing valid schema syntax</dt>
<dd style="margin-left: 8">A schema MUST successfully validate against its meta-schema, which constrains the syntax of the available keywords.

Each vocabulary typically identifies a meta-schema consisting only of the vocabulary's keywords.  </p>

For example, if two schemas "#alice" and "#bob" both have an "allOf" property that refers to the other, a naive validator might get stuck in an infinite recursive loop trying to validate the instance.  Schemas SHOULD NOT make use of infinite recursive nesting like this; the behavior is undefined.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.2.4.4.p.1">Subschema objects (or booleans) are recognized by their use with known applicator keywords or with location-reserving keywords such as <a href="#defs" class="xref">"$defs"</a> that take one or more subschemas as a value.  These keywords may be "$defs" and the standard applicators from this document, or extension keywords from a known vocabulary, or implementation-specific custom keywords.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.4.4.p.2">Multi-level structures of unknown keywords are capable of introducing nested subschemas, which would be subject to the processing rules for "$id".  Therefore, having a reference target in such an unrecognized structure cannot be reliably implemented, and the resulting behavior is undefined.  Similarly, a reference target under a known keyword, for which the value is known not to be a schema, results in undefined behavior in order to avoid burdening implementations with the need to detect such targets.  <a id="CREF12" class="info">[CREF12]<span class="info">These scenarios are analogous to fetching a schema over HTTP but receiving a response with a Content-Type other than application/schema+json.  An implementation can certainly try to interpret it as a schema, but the origin server offered no guarantee that it actually is any such thing.  Therefore, interpreting it as such has security implications and may produce unpredictable results.  </span></a> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.4.4.p.3">Note that single-level custom keywords with identical syntax and semantics to "$defs" do not allow for any intervening "$id" keywords, and therefore will behave correctly under implementations that attempt to use any reference target as a schema.

<p id="rfc.section.8.2.4.5.p.1">The use of URIs to identify remote schemas does not necessarily mean anything is downloaded, but instead JSON Schema implementations SHOULD understand ahead of time which schemas they will be using, and the URIs that identify them.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.4.5.p.2">When schemas are downloaded, for example by a generic user-agent that doesn't know until runtime which schemas to download, see <a href="#hypermedia" class="xref">Usage for Hypermedia</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.4.5.p.3">Implementations SHOULD be able to associate arbitrary URIs with an arbitrary schema and/or automatically associate a schema's "$id"-given URI, depending on the trust that the validator has in the schema.  Such URIs and schemas can be supplied to an implementation prior to processing instances, or may be noted within a schema document as it is processed, producing associations as shown in appendix <a href="#idExamples" class="xref">A</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.4.5.p.4">A schema MAY (and likely will) have multiple URIs, but there is no way for a URI to identify more than one schema. When multiple schemas try to identify as the same URI, validators SHOULD raise an error condition.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.8.2.4.6.p.5">When an implementation then looks inside the &lt;#/items&gt; schema, it encounters the &lt;#item&gt; reference, and resolves this to &lt;https://example.net/root.json#item&gt;, which it has seen defined in this same document and can therefore use automatically.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.2.4.6.p.6">When an implementation encounters the reference to "other.json", it resolves this to &lt;https://example.net/other.json&gt;, which is not defined in this document.

Are there circumstances in which automatic network dereferencing is allowed?  A same origin policy?  A user-configurable option?

<a href="#rfc.appendix.B">Appendix B.</a> Manipulating schema documents and references</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">Various tools have been created to rearrange schema documents based on how and where references ("$ref") appear.  This appendix discusses which use cases and actions are compliant with this specification.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.B.1">B.1.</a> Bundling schema resources into a single document</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.1.p.1">A set of schema resources intended for use together can be organized with each in its own schema document, all in the same schema document, or any granularity of document grouping in between.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.1.p.2">Numerous tools exist to perform various sorts of reference removal.  A common case of this is producing a single file where all references can be resolved within that file.  This is typically done to simplify distribution, or to simplify coding so that various invocations of JSON Schema libraries do not have to keep track of and load a large number of resources.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.1.p.3">This transformation can be safely and reversibly done as long as all static references (e.g. "$ref") use URI-references that resolve to canonical URIs, and all schema resources have an absolute-URI as the "$id" in their root schema.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.1.p.4">With these conditions met, each external resource can be copied under "$defs", without breaking any references among the resources' schema objects, and without changing any aspect of validation or annotation results.  The names of the schemas under "$defs" do not affect behavior, assuming they are each unique, as they do not appear in canonical URIs for the embedded resources.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.B.2">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.B.2">B.2.</a> Reference removal is not always safe</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.1">Attempting to remove all references and produce a single schema document does not, in all cases, produce a schema with identical behavior to the original form.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.2.p.2">Since "$ref" is now treated like any other keyword, with other keywords allowed in the same schema objects, fully supporting non-recursive "$ref" removal in all cases can require relatively complex schema manipulations.  It is beyond the scope of this specification to determine or provide a set of safe "$ref" removal transformations, as they depend not only on the schema structure but also on the intended usage.  </p>

<p>Consider the following two schemas describing a simple recursive tree structure, where each node in the tree can have a "data" field of any type.  The first schema allows and ignores other instance properties.  The second is more strict and only allows the "data" and "children" properties.  An example instance with "data" misspelled as "daat" is also shown.  </p>
<pre>

// tree schema, extensible
{
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema",
    "$id": "https://example.com/tree",
    "$recursiveAnchor": true,

    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "data": true,
        "children": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "$recursiveRef": "#"
            }
        }
    }
}

// strict-tree schema, guards against misspelled properties
{
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema",
    "$id": "https://example.com/strict-tree",
    "$recursiveAnchor": true,

    "$ref": "tree",
    "unevaluatedProperties": false
}

// instance with misspelled field
{
    "children": [ { "daat": 1 } ]
}

                </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.1">If we apply the "strict-tree" schema to the instance, we will follow the "$ref" to the "tree" schema, examine its "children" subschema, and find the "$recursiveAnchor" in its "items" subschema.  At this point, the dynamic path is "#/$ref/properties/children/items/$recursiveRef".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.2">The base URI at this point is "https://example.com/tree", so the "$recursiveRef" initially resolves to "https://example.com/tree#".  Since "$recursiveAnchor" is true, we examine the dynamic path to see if there is a different base URI to use.  We find "$recursiveAnchor" with a true value at the dynamic paths of "#" and "#/$ref".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.3">The outermost is "#", which is the root schema of the "strict-tree" schema, so we use its base URI of "https://example.com/strict-tree", which produces a final resolved URI of "https://example.com/strict-tree#" for the "$recursiveRef".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.C.p.4">This way, the recursion in the "tree" schema recurses to the root of "strict-tree", instead of only applying "strict-tree" to the instance root, but applying "tree" to instance children.  </p>

<a href="#rfc.appendix.D">Appendix D.</a> Working with vocabularies</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.D.1">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.D.1">D.1.</a> Best practices for vocabulary and meta-schema authors</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.1">Vocabulary authors should take care to avoid keyword name collisions if the vocabulary is intended for broad use, and potentially combined with other vocabularies.  JSON Schema does not provide any formal namespacing system, but also does not constrain keyword names, allowing for any number of namespacing approaches.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.2">Vocabularies may build on each other, such as by defining the behavior of their keywords with respect to the behavior of keywords from another vocabulary, or by using a keyword from another vocabulary with a restricted or expanded set of acceptable values.  Not all such vocabulary re-use will result in a new vocabulary that is compatible with the vocabulary on which it is built.  Vocabulary authors should clearly document what level of compatibility, if any, is expected.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.3">Meta-schema authors should not use "$vocabulary" to combine multiple vocabularies that define conflicting syntax or semantics for the same keyword.  As semantic conflicts are not generally detectable through schema validation, implementations are not expected to detect such conflicts.  If conflicting vocabularies are declared, the resulting behavior is undefined.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.4">Vocabulary authors should provide a meta-schema that validates the expected usage of the vocabulary's keywords on their own.  Such meta-schemas should not forbid additional keywords, and must not forbid any keywords from the Core vocabulary.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.5">It is recommended that meta-schema authors reference each vocabulary's meta-schema using the <a href="#allOf" class="xref">"allOf"</a> keyword, although other mechanisms for constructing the meta-schema may be appropriate for certain use cases.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.6">The recursive nature of meta-schemas makes the "$recursiveAnchor" and "$recursiveRef" keywords particularly useful for extending existing meta-schemas, as can be seen in the JSON Hyper-Schema meta-schema which extends the Validation meta-schema.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.7">Meta-schemas may impose additional constraints, including describing keywords not present in any vocabulary, beyond what the meta-schemas associated with the declared vocabularies describe.  This allows for restricting usage to a subset of a vocabulary, and for validating locally defined keywords not intended for re-use.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.8">However, meta-schemas should not contradict any vocabularies that they declare, such as by requiring a different JSON type than the vocabulary expects.  The resulting behavior is undefined.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.1.p.9">Meta-schemas intended for local use, with no need to test for vocabulary support in arbitrary implementations, can safely omit "$vocabulary" entirely.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.D.2">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.D.2">D.2.</a> <a href="#example-meta-schema" id="example-meta-schema">Example meta-schema with vocabulary declarations</a>
</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.D.2.p.1">This meta-schema explicitly declares both the Core and Applicator vocabularies, together with an extension vocabulary, and combines their meta-schemas with an "allOf".  The extension vocabulary's meta-schema, which describes only the keywords in that vocabulary, is shown after the main example meta-schema.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.2.p.2">The main example meta-schema also restricts the usage of the Applicator vocabulary by forbidding the keywords prefixed with "unevaluated", which are particularly complex to implement.  This does not change the semantics or set of keywords defined by the Applicator vocabulary.  It just ensures that schemas using this meta-schema that attempt to use the keywords prefixed with "unevaluted" will fail validation against this meta-schema.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.2.p.3">Finally, this meta-schema describes the syntax of a keyword, "localKeyword", that is not part of any vocabulary.  Presumably, the implementors and users of this meta-schema will understand the semantics of "localKeyword".  JSON Schema does not define any mechanism for expressing keyword semantics outside of vocabularies, making them unsuitable for use except in a specific environment in which they are understood.  </p>
<p>This meta-schema combines several vocabularies for general use.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.D.2.p.4">As shown above, even though each of the single-vocabulary meta-schemas referenced in the general-use meta-schema's "allOf" declares its corresponding vocabulary, this new meta-schema must re-declare them.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.2.p.5">The standard meta-schemas that combine all vocabularies defined by the Core and Validation specification, and that combine all vocabularies defined by those specifications as well as the Hyper-Schema specification, demonstrate additional complex combinations.  These URIs for these meta-schemas may be found in the Validation and Hyper-Schema specifications, respectively.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.D.2.p.6">While the general-use meta-schema can validate the syntax of "minDate", it is the vocabulary that defines the logic behind the semantic meaning of "minDate".  Without an understanding of the semantics (in this example, that the instance value must be a date equal to or after the date provided as the keyword's value in the schema), an implementation can only validate the syntactic usage.  In this case, that means validating that it is a date-formatted string (using "pattern" to ensure that it is validated even when "format" functions purely as an annotation, as explained in the <a href="#json-schema-validation" class="xref">Validation specification</a>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.appendix.E">
<a href="#rfc.appendix.E">Appendix E.</a> References and generative use cases</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.E.p.1">While the presence of references is expected to be transparent to validation results, generative use cases such as code generators and UI renderers often consider references to be semantically significant.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.p.2">To make such use case-specific semantics explicit, the best practice is to create an annotation keyword for use in the same schema object alongside of a reference keyword such as "$ref".  </p>
<p>For example, here is a hypothetical keyword for determining whether a code generator should consider the reference target to be a distinct class, and how those classes are related.  Note that this example is solely for illustrative purposes, and is not intended to propose a functional code generation keyword.  </p>

{
    "allOf": [
        {
            "classRelation": "is-a",
            "$ref": "classes/base.json"
        },
        {
            "$ref": "fields/common.json"
        }

        "date": {
            "$ref": "types/dateStruct.json",
        }
    }
}

                </pre>
<p id="rfc.section.E.p.3">Here, this schema represents some sort of object-oriented class.  The first reference in the "allOf" is noted as the base class.  The second is not assigned a class relationship, meaning that the code generator should combine the target's definition with this one as if no reference were involved.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.p.4">Looking at the properties, "foo" is flagged as object composition, while the "date" property is not.  It is simply a field with sub-fields, rather than an instance of a distinct class.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.E.p.5">This style of usage requires the annotation to be in the same object as the reference, which must be recognizable as a reference.  </p>
