Understanding JSON Schema
=========================

<img src="understanding/octopus.svg" className="w-1/2 float-right" />

JSON Schema is a powerful tool for validating the structure of JSON
data. However, learning to use it by reading its specification is like
learning to drive a car by looking at its blueprints. You don\'t need to
know how an electric motor fits together if all you want to do is pick
up the groceries. This book, therefore, aims to be the friendly driving
instructor for JSON Schema. It\'s for those that want to write it and
understand it, but maybe aren\'t interested in building their own
car—er, writing their own JSON Schema validator — just yet.

> This tutorial describes JSON Schema draft 2020-12. Earlier versions of
JSON Schema are not completely compatible with the format
described here, but for the most part, those differences are noted
in the text.

## Where to begin?

-   This book uses some novel [conventions](../understanding-json-schema/conventions)
    for showing schema examples and relating JSON Schema to your
    programming language of choice.
-   If you\'re not sure what a schema is, check out [What is a schema?](../understanding-json-schema/about).
-   [The basics](../understanding-json-schema/basics) chapter should be enough to get you started
    with understanding the core [JSON Schema Reference](../understanding-json-schema/reference).
-   When you start developing large schemas with many nested and
    repeated sections, check out [Structuring a complex schema](../understanding-json-schema/structuring).
-   [json-schema.org](http://json-schema.org) has a number of resources,
    including the official specification and tools for working with JSON
    Schema from various programming languages.
-   There are a number of [online JSON Schema tools](https://json-schema.org/implementations.html#validator-web%20(online))
    that allow you to run your own JSON schemas against example
    documents. These can be very handy if you want to try things out
    without installing any software.
