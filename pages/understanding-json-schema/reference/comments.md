<Star label="New in draft 7" />

The `$comment` [keyword](../../learn/glossary#keyword) is strictly intended for adding comments to a
schema. Its value must always be a string. Unlike the annotations
`title`, `description`, and `examples`, JSON schema [implementations](../../learn/glossary#implementation)
aren\'t allowed to attach any meaning or behavior to it whatsoever, and
may even strip them at any time. Therefore, they are useful for leaving
notes to future editors of a JSON schema, but should not be used to
communicate to users of the schema.

```json
    {
      "$comment": "Created by John Doe",
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "country": {
          "$comment": "TODO: add enum of countries"
        }
      }
    }
```
