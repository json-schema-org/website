JSON Schema offers powerful features for constructing complex and flexible schema structures. The main approaches to combining JSON schemas are the following: 

- **Modular combination**. This approach allows you to break down your data model into reusable components, fostering modularity, and maintainability. In [Modular JSON Schema combination](../../understanding-json-schema/structuring) you will learn about creating and utilizing reusable schemas, subschemas, and even self-referential (recursive) schemas. 

- **Boolean combination**. This approach allows you to validate a single data value against multiple criteria at the same time. JSON Schema provides a set of keywords that act like boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to achieve this. To enhance your understanding of these keywords and learn how to leverage them for complex validations, see [Boolean JSON Schema combination](../../understanding-json-schema/reference/combining). 

By mastering these techniques you will make your JSON schemas more scalable, flexible, and easy to maintain.
