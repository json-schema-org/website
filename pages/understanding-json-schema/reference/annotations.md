title: "Annotations"
section: docs

JSON Schema includes a few [keywords](../../learn/glossary#keyword), that aren\'t strictly used for
validation, but are used to describe parts of a schema. None of these
\"annotation\" keywords are required, but they are encouraged for good
practice, and can make your schema \"self-documenting\".

Annotation keywords can be used in any schema or sub-schemas. Like other keywords, they may be used once.

The `title` and `description` keywords must be strings. A \"title\" will
preferably be short, whereas a \"description\" will provide a more
lengthy explanation about the purpose of the data described by the
schema.

The `default` keyword specifies a default value. This value is not used
to fill in missing values during the validation process. Non-validation
tools such as documentation generators or form generators may use this
value to give hints to users about how to use a value. However,
`default` is typically used to express that if a value is missing, then
the value is semantically the same as if the value was present with the
default value. The value of `default` should validate against the schema
in which it resides, but that isn\'t required.

The `examples` keyword is a place to provide an array of examples that
validate against the schema. This isn\'t used for validation, but may
help with explaining the effect and purpose of the schema to a reader.
Each entry should validate against the schema in which it resides, but
that isn\'t strictly required. There is no need to duplicate the
`default` value in the `examples` array, since `default` will be treated
as another example.

<Star label="New in draft 7" />
The boolean keywords `readOnly` and `writeOnly` are typically used in an
API context. `readOnly` indicates that a value should not be modified.
It could be used to indicate that a `PUT` request that changes a value
would result in a `400 Bad Request` response. `writeOnly` indicates that
a value may be set, but will remain hidden. In could be used to indicate
you can set a value with a `PUT` request, but it would not be included
when retrieving that record with a `GET` request.

<Star label="New in draft 2019-09" />
The `deprecated` keyword is a boolean that indicates that the [instance](../../learn/glossary#instance)
value the keyword applies to should not be used and may be removed in
the future.
