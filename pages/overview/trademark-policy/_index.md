## JSON Schema Trademark Policy

"JSON Schema" and the JSON Schema logo are trademarks held by the active members of the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) as per the [JSON Schema governance document](https://github.com/json-schema-org/community/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md). Trademark stewardship follows active governance as TSC membership changes over time and trademark rights transfer to the current active members rather than remaining with past members. These trademarks are maintained on behalf of the JSON Schema community to ensure that the name remains a reliable indicator of the specification and resources maintained by the project.

You do not need permission to use the JSON Schema trademarks in the following ways: describing your software's compatibility with JSON Schema (i.e. "supports JSON Schema 2020-12"), discussing, teaching, or writing about JSON Schema, or linking to json-schema.org.

You may not use the JSON Schema trademarks in a way that implies endorsement, sponsorship, or official status that does not exist. You may not use "JSON Schema" or any confusingly similar name as part of your own product name, company name, domain name, or service name without prior written permission from the TSC. You may not use the JSON Schema logo or name in a way that suggests your specification, standard, or schema language is the official JSON Schema specification when it is not maintained by the JSON Schema TSC.

If you have questions about permitted uses of the JSON Schema trademarks, or wish to report potential misuse, please open a GitHub Issue at [json-schema-org/community](https://github.com/json-schema-org/community/issues). This policy may be updated from time to time by the TSC. This policy is inspired by trademark policies from the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/), [Arch Linux](https://terms.archlinux.org/docs/trademark-policy/), and the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/legal/trademark-usage).
