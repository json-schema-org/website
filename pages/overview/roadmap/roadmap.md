## 2023/2024 Roadmap

ðŸ‘‹ Dear JSON Schema Community,

We are thrilled to announce the completion of the JSON Schema roadmap for 23-24 ðŸŽ‰ , a result of dedicated efforts and collaboration within our community. We invite each of you to join us on this exciting journey as we strive to address the most significant challenges JSON Schema faces. Together, we can build a better future for JSON Schema!

To ensure transparency and inclusivity, we have documented our roadmap on GitHub. You can find all the details and progress updates by visiting the following link ðŸ‘‰ [JSON Schema Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/14/views/13).

The roadmap is a result of the two-day in-person summit, where we identified the biggest problems we should be solving. For those interested in a deeper dive into the summit proceedings, including the agenda, notes, and write-up, we encourage you to explore the summit report [here](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/discussions/391).

## Our key objectives for 23-24 are:

- Refine the Contributor's experience
- Define a strategy to better support implementers
- Identify a list of critical interfaces that implementations should have
- Complete the new version of the Spec
- Publish the new webpage
- Complete the OpenJS onboarding
- Research of existing implementations by language
- Define a sustainability strategy
- Define and roll out the documentation strategy
- Implement and scale the new governance model
- Enhance public communications strategy

We encourage you to review the roadmap in this [board](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/14/views/1). Each objective has its own dedicated GitHub issue. When checking each issue, you will notice that some have been marked as "unspecified," indicating the need for collaborative input from our community to define success criteria, deliverables, and task breakdowns.

### A Call for Collaborators!
The individuals assigned to each issue have taken up the responsibility to define, drive, and work on the respective tasks. However, we are actively looking for contributors! We welcome and encourage everyone to contribute to tasks where they feel they can add value.

Join Us to shape the future of JSON Schema
