# Similar Technologies Overview

[**JSON Schema**](https://json-schema.org/) is not the only game in town when it comes to data validation and description. Here are some other technologies that share similar goals:

##  Similar Technologies

* **JSON Constraint Rules (JCR):** JCR aims to provide a more expressive way to define constraints on JSON data compared to JSON Schema. While still under development, you can learn more about it on GitHub: [http://codalogic.github.io/jcr/](http://codalogic.github.io/jcr/).

* **CBOR Constrained Data Description Language (CBL):** Similar to JCR, CBL focuses on describing constraints, but specifically for the CBOR data format. Dive deeper into CBL in the CBL IETF draft: [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cordell-jcr-co-constraints/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cordell-jcr-co-constraints/).

* **CBOR Data Definition Language (Cddl):** While not strictly focused on constraints, Cddl allows defining the structure of CBOR data. Check out the Cddl IETF draft: [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl-08](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl-08) for more information.

* **AJV (Another JSON Schema Validator):** A high-performance JSON Schema validator with extensive support for various features. Explore it at AJV website: [https://ajv.js.org/](https://ajv.js.org/).
