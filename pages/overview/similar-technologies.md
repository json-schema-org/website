While we think that JSON Schema has a unique value proposition, we'd like to provide visibility to other technologies that share similar goals:



* **JSON Constraint Rules (JCR):** JCR aims to provide a more expressive way to define constraints on JSON data compared to JSON Schema. While still under development, you can learn more about it on GitHub: [http://codalogic.github.io/jcr/](http://codalogic.github.io/jcr/).

* **CBOR Constrained Data Description Language (CBL):** Similar to JCR, CBL focuses on describing constraints, but specifically for the CBOR data format. Dive deeper into CBL in the CBL IETF draft: [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cordell-jcr-co-constraints/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-cordell-jcr-co-constraints/).

* **CBOR Data Definition Language (Cddl):** While not strictly focused on constraints, Cddl allows defining the structure of CBOR data. Check out the Cddl IETF draft: [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl-08](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl-08) for more information.
