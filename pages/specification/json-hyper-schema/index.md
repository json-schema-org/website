title: JSON Hyper-Schema
---

### Introduction

JSON Hyper-Schema enables the definition of hyperlinks within JSON documents. It allows schemas to describe JSON data's structure and validation rules and provides information about navigating and interacting with the data.

A typical use case of the hyper-schema is working with hypermedia APIs, where the JSON responses include links to other resources, much like HTML does with hyperlinks.
