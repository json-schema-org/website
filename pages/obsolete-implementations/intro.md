_**NOTE:** Due to the long gap after draft-04, many projects that implemented that draft became inactive by the time draft-06 was published, or are looking for new contributors to move forward.  Such projects are listed here_

_For implementations supporting (or actively working towards) draft-06 or later, see the main [Implementations](implementations) page._

Implementations below are written in different languages, and support part, or all, of the specification.

Implementations are classified based on their functionality. When known, the license of the project is also mentioned.

If you have updates to this list, make a pull request on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website).
