## The Project

The main goal of JSON Schema's [documentation project](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/discussions/687) is to create a scalable documentation architecture that is clear, consistent, and comprehensive. To achieve this through GSoD, we focused on:

- **[Restructuring the specification docs](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website/pull/823)**: This section needs a better structure to provide easy access to the latest specification versions. Users need to understand how JSON Schema has evolved across different releases and the features introduced in each version. Restructuring this section makes it more useful for all the JSON Schema [personas](https://github.com/json-schema-org/community/issues/336#personas).
- **[Restructuring the reference documentation](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website/issues/790)**: We are creating a new version of the reference documents, using modern documentation principles, such as the [diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/), to improve the existing "Understanding JSON Schema" book. This will provide a more efficient onboarding experience and better content organization.

## The Update

Since May, the team ([Valeria Hernandez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/valeriahhdez/), [Blessing Ene Anyebe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anyebe-blessing-ene-kwennb/), [Dhairya Amrish Majmudar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dhairya-majmudar/), and [Benjamin Granados](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjagranados/).) has been working hard to achieve these goals. We've conducted extensive research, mapped out [developer experience journeys](<(https://www.figma.com/board/TRjQUw33K93y8RlJMSRkJs/JSON-dev-journey?node-id=0-1&t=gYkdGtHk2sKrCQM0-0)>), implemented the [keywords page](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/keywords), and added on-page tables of content. We've also introduced [Next-Previous navigation](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website/pull/807) sections and restructured the [specification docs](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website/pull/823).

What's pending? We're currently working on the [JSON Hyper-Schema](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website/issues/896) and [Migration pages](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website/issues/897) as part of the specification docs. Additionally, we're drafting style guides and creating [overview content buckets](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website/issues/803) to enhance the documentation.

## Conclusion

Our documentation efforts are expanding daily, and your contributions can improve them. There are several ways you can help, including:

- Breaking down large documents to improve structure
- Creating missing documentation for the Troubleshooting and Scaling stages of the developer journey
- Documenting the three missing JSON Schema keywords
- Contributing to the Migration page

Our docs meetings are held every Tuesday at 3:00 PM UTC. You're welcome to join the #gsod24 channel in the JSON Schema [Slack workspace](https://json-schema.org/slack) and send us a message with your email address so we can add you to the meeting.

Thank you for your interest in the JSON Schema documentation project. We look forward to your contributions and seeing how these improvements will benefit the wider developer community.

The JSON Schema's Google Season of Docs Team.
