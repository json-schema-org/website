# JSON Schema documentation contributing guide 

This is guide describes the workflow to contribute to the JSON Schema technical documentation. If you would like to contribute to other aspects of the JSON Schema website, like writing blog articles or publishing a case study, please read the website's [Contributing Guide](/website/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details. 

## Welcome
Thank you for helping us improve our documentation.

This guide is intended for use by documentation contributors and will help you get started with the basics of our working processes.

## Before you start
To contribute to the JSON Schema documentation you will need to complete the following steps:

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github), if you don't have one already.
2. Read our [Code of Conduct](https://json-schema.org/overview/code-of-conduct).
3. [Install the JSON Schema website](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) on your computer.
4. Read our style guide. 

## Community engagement
To stay updated with news about the JSON Schema project and its documentation, engage with our team, ask questions, and discuss ideas, please join our [Slack workspace](https://json-schema.org/slack). We particularly recommend the following channels:

- #documentation: Discussions related to the JSON Schema documentation.

- #website: Discussions related to our website.

- #introductions: Self-introductions and connecting with other members of the community.

- #community-announcements: Events and updates related to the JSON Schema project.

- #anouncements: Important announcement from the JSON Schema organization.

- #stack-overflow: Stack overflow questions tagged with JSON Schema.
  
## Best practices

This is a list of best practices the JSON Schema project strives and resources we recommend for additional information:

1. File and branching naming conventions: We use dashes instead of spaces, and lowercase letters to name .md files and branches. For example: _implementers-guide.md_, _web-feat-diataxis_.
2. Commit messages: To learn how to write good commit messages, see [Step-by-step guide on how to write good commit messages on Git](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-better-git-commit-messages/).

## Contribution workflow 
We value documentation and appreciate efforts to help us improve our documents. There are two ways you can contribute to improve our documentation:


1. Review pull requests
2. Work on an existing issue 
3. Propose changes 

### Review pull requests

This is a great way to start contributing. Reviewing pull requests helps you get familiar with our workflows, know how other people contribute, and understand the project's needs and goals. 

### Work on an existing issue

To work on an existing issue, go to the [JSON Schema docs board](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/16) and check all the open issues related to documentation. 

If the issue you select has no asignees, you can claim the issue by assigning it to yourself and tag @benjagm in the comments to let us know you'll be working on it. 

If the issue you select has already an asignee, write a comment expressing your interest in collaborating with them. The JSON Schema respects the order in which people claim issues, therefore, you will have to check if the asignee is accepting collaborations.

After you have been assigned to an issue, fork the [json-schema-org/website](https://github.com/json-schema-org/website) repository and create a new branch to work on the changes. 

### Propose changes

To propose modifications to our documentation that do not have an issue in the [documentation board](https://github.com/orgs/json-schema-org/projects/16), you can [create a GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository) and select the *Documentation* template. After that, you can decide whether you want to work on the changes yourself or let someone else claim the issue. If you decide to work on the issue, assign it to yourself and commit the changes to a new branch. 

## Create a Pull Request

To submit your work to review by the community, open a draft pull request to the main upstream branch, and add the issue your pull request solves. Add @benjagm as a reviewer of your pull request, and let us know in the #documentation Slack channel. 

The reviewers might ask for additional changes. When the reviewers approve your pull request, you can merge your changes into the main branch and your contribution to the project will be complete!

We created this guide based on templates from [The Good Docs Project](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/).
